# Suse -  SCC Frontend Task

This project is the task related to [Github-repo](https://gist.github.com/digitaltom/04dfcf8e5855aa403f955d2bce2b16e0)

## Setup 

1. to setup this project clone this repo in your local

2. Run 

    `
    python3 -m http.server
    `
3. In your browser go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

4. Make sure you are connected to the internet to load the bootstrap CDN.

## Note: 

This is a simple setup and is the bare minimal html UI setup. For production use we can use webpack and other tools for compiling the JS code and bundling it. Also we can improve a lot on the folder structure like using a server side framework like Rails to load the template and keep the code modular.
